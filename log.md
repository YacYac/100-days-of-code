# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I started doing this on Sunday prior to logging this on Github. Since I've managed an hour each day until today so I'm going to count it. From now on though I'll have to log it in Github though.

### Day 1: January 8, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Started the Tic Tac Toe app. Managed to get the gameboard to render and react when I click on each square.

**Thoughts**: I've been reading You Don't Know JS for the past couple of weeks and not really programming. I decided it was time to get back to applying some of the knowledge I've retained. Also I want to see how well I can manage without jQuery and Bootstrap for these last two projects so they don't become a crutch.

### Day 2: January 9, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Added a setup screen that let's a player choose which side they want to play as.

**Thoughts**: Today went fairly smoothly, but the interface is feeling really janky to me. Still adjusting to not relying on Bootstrap for some basic semblance of aesthetic quality.

### Day 3: January 10, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Re-implemented the interface in Flexbox. Implemented the win conditions. Added a computer player. Submitted the completed project to FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I came across the great post, [Understanding Flexbox: Everything you need to know](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/understanding-flexbox-everything-you-need-to-know-b4013d4dc9af#.9nij4zlfe), which helped me figure out how to lay out my UI much more smoothly. After that point, everything kind of came together really smoothly. On to the last project!

### Day 4: January 11, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Got the basic's of Simon's UI up.

**Thoughts**: Trying to overlap divs and get a decent looking Simon device. Went kind of slowly today.

### Day 5: January 13, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Reworked Simon's UI after reading about CSS images the day before.

**Thoughts**: I took yesterday off from coding but did some reading on [pure CSS images](https://medium.com/dailycssimages/a-beginners-guide-to-pure-css-images-ef9a5d069dd2#.wehm7k2xb). Using that info I've reworked my Simon UI. The result feels more manageable and way less of a mess than my first try.

### Day 6: January 14, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Finished UI layout

**Thoughts**: Finished laying out the Simon game's UI. Today went pretty smooth. I'll spend tomorrow working on behaviour in JS.

### Day 7: January 15, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Finished Simon project

**Thoughts**: I ended up plowing through all of the JS work for the Simon game today. I probably spent about 8 or so hours on it. I've completed my Front End Certification with FreeCodeCamp!
