# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I started doing this on Sunday prior to logging this on Github. Since I've managed an hour each day until today so I'm going to count it. From now on though I'll have to log it in Github though.

### Day 1: January 8, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Started the Tic Tac Toe app. Managed to get the gameboard to render and react when I click on each square.

**Thoughts**: I've been reading You Don't Know JS for the past couple of weeks and not really programming. I decided it was time to get back to applying some of the knowledge I've retained. Also I want to see how well I can manage without jQuery and Bootstrap for these last two projects so they don't become a crutch.

### Day 2: January 9, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Added a setup screen that let's a player choose which side they want to play as.

**Thoughts**: Today went fairly smoothly, but the interface is feeling really janky to me. Still adjusting to not relying on Bootstrap for some basic semblance of aesthetic quality.

### Day 3: January 10, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Re-implemented the interface in Flexbox. Implemented the win conditions. Added a computer player. Submitted the completed project to FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I came across the great post, [Understanding Flexbox: Everything you need to know](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/understanding-flexbox-everything-you-need-to-know-b4013d4dc9af#.9nij4zlfe), which helped me figure out how to lay out my UI much more smoothly. After that point, everything kind of came together really smoothly. On to the last project!

### Day 4: January 11, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Got the basic's of Simon's UI up.

**Thoughts**: Trying to overlap divs and get a decent looking Simon device. Went kind of slowly today.

### Day 5: January 13, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Reworked Simon's UI after reading about CSS images the day before.

**Thoughts**: I took yesterday off from coding but did some reading on [pure CSS images](https://medium.com/dailycssimages/a-beginners-guide-to-pure-css-images-ef9a5d069dd2#.wehm7k2xb). Using that info I've reworked my Simon UI. The result feels more manageable and way less of a mess than my first try.

### Day 6: January 14, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Finished UI layout

**Thoughts**: Finished laying out the Simon game's UI. Today went pretty smooth. I'll spend tomorrow working on behaviour in JS.

### Day 7: January 15, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Finished Simon project

**Thoughts**: I ended up plowing through all of the JS work for the Simon game today. I probably spent about 8 or so hours on it. I've completed my Front End Certification with FreeCodeCamp!

### Day 8: January 16, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Started rebuilding my personal site.

**Thoughts**: I was mostly re-reading You Don't Know JS - Scope & Closures today. React is next on FreeCodeCamp's list, but it seems like quite a big jump in some ways, and I'm not sure if I'm secured enough in my basic JS skills to jump up to it yet. So in the meantime I'm doing some basic work on rebuilding my personal site that I made in codepen as a static standalone site. I'm planning on not relying on jquery or bootstrap this time, much like I have been doing with my last few FCC projects.

### Day 9: January 17, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Started refactoring Simon game.

**Thoughts**: After finishing re-reading Scopes & Closures I decided to refactor my Simon game. I'm putting most of the global variables inside of a simon module. I managed to reimplement the power on and off functionality so far. It's definitely more code, but the design does seem cleaner in many ways.

### Day 10: January 18, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Finished refactoring Simon game.

**Thoughts**: After starting on it yesterday, I dug into refactoring my Simon game to move all of the global variables and much of the state, I think, into a javascript module. It was kind of challanging diving back into finished code to pull it back apart and re-implement working features. I think in the end the design of the code is much clearer now. Though the JS did end up going from 261 lines of code to 352 lines in the refactoring. I think I'm mostly done with the Simon project for now. I do have a few minor CSS changes I want to get to at some point though.

### Day 11: January 19, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Worked on personal site.

**Thoughts**: I worked on doing a standalone version of my portfolio site today that doesn't need to use codepen.
